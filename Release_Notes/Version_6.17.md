# CSOUND VERSION 6.17 RELEASE NOTES - DRAFT - DRAFT - DRAFT - DRAFT 

Mainly a bug-fixing release but also a major re-organisation of the
libraries to move all opcodes with dependencies into a separate plugins
repository. The only exception to this is the OSC opcodes (which
depend on liblo). This is in part a preparation for Csound7. This is
the last release using the current parser (v.2).

-- The Developers

## USER-LEVEL CHANGES

### New opcodes

- scanmap and scansmap are like the xscanmap/xscansmap opcodes but
  work with the mainstream scan opcodes.

- trigexpseg, triglinseg are aliases for trigExpseg, trigLinseg.

- xscan opcodes are deprecated as they add nothing to the scan opcodes.

- bformdec2 provides more ambisonic decoding of bformat audio.

### New gen

### Orchestra

- Message printing has been revised so -m0 suppresses (nearly) all
    messages

- add channel count to list_audio_devices (called when the flag
  --devices is used so that it can be parsed by frontends.
